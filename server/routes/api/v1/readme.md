# Intro 
In DevSecOps, "less privilege" refers to the principle of least privilege (PoLP), which means granting users, applications, or services the minimal level of access required to perform their tasks, and nothing more. When working with an API, this principle ensures that:

API users (such as applications or services) only have the minimum permissions they need to interact with the API. Each API key or token is assigned only the specific roles, access levels, or scopes necessary to perform a given function.Limiting exposure of sensitive data or operations by making sure an API consumer can only access certain endpoints or perform certain actions (e.g., read-only vs. read-write access).

# Example in DevSecOps:
If you have an API that manages user data, and an application only needs to fetch user information, the API key associated with this app should only have read-only access to user data, not permissions to modify or delete it.
By enforcing least privilege, you minimize the risk of accidental or malicious damage in case the API key is compromised. Applying this principle helps to reduce security risks, ensuring that even if an account or service is compromised, the damage potential is limited.

# Task

you will be working in this file : https://github.com/OpenSourceFellows/amplify/blob/main/server/routes/api/twilio.js

To apply the principle of least privilege to this code, we can refactor by limiting access to sensitive data (e.g., Twilio credentials) and restricting how the database and Twilio are used. Here's how:

Copy and paste both tasks in AI and ask it to refactor the file based on these task items below 
- [x] 1. Limit Environment Variable Exposure:
Only use the Twilio credentials when necessary and avoid storing them in variables accessible throughout the code.

- [x] 2. Scoped Access:
Ensure only specific roles or users can send SMS through Twilio, instead of making this functionality available to all users.
